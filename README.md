# Social_Media_Analysis
## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on social media metrics to identify influencers with the highest numbers of subscribers, views, likes, and shares. The insights gained will help guide collaboration and marketing strategies based on real performance data

## Scope:  
•	Analyze key performance metrics: Subscribers, Views, Likes, and Shares
• Compare and rank influencers to highlight those best suited for potential partnerships

## Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning: Process the collected data to remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
2. Analysis: Evaluate and rank influencers based on core engagement metrics
3. Visualization: Create visual representations (charts/graphs) to illustrate findings.

## Expected Outcomes: 
•	A ranked list of influencers based on subscribers, views, and likes.
•	Actionable insights into the most effective influencers for potential collaborations.
•	Recommendations for outreach strategies based on analysis.

This overview sets the stage for a detailed investigation into influencer engagement and collaboration opportunities.
