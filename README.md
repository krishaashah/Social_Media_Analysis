# Social_Media_Analysis
The primary goal of this project is to analyze social media metrics using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Visual Studio Code as an editor, to identify influencers with the highest number of subscribers, views, and likes. This will help us find suitable candidates for collaboration and marketing opportunities.

## Scope:  
•	Collect data on influencers from various social media platforms.
•	Analyze key metrics, including: Subscribers, Views, Likes and Shares.
•	Compare and rank influencers based on these metrics to identify potential collaboration partners.

## Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Utilize APIs or web scraping tools to gather data on influencers.
2. Data Cleaning: Process the collected data to remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
3. Analysis: Perform quantitative analysis to determine the top influencers based on the specified metrics.
4. Visualization: Create visual representations (charts/graphs) to illustrate findings.

## Expected Outcomes: 
•	A ranked list of influencers based on subscribers, views, and likes.
•	Insights into the most effective influencers for potential collaborations.
•	Recommendations for outreach strategies based on analysis.

This overview sets the stage for a detailed investigation into influencer engagement and collaboration opportunities.
